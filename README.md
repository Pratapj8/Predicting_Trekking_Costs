# End-to-end Trekking_cost_predict

## 🏞️ Trekking Cost Predictor ⛰️

Welcome to the Trekking Cost Predictor project! This is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to estimate the cost of a trekking trip based on various factors. Whether you're planning a solo adventure or a group expedition, this tool can help you budget effectively.

### ✨ Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict trekking costs. It covers the entire ML lifecycle, from data ingestion and transformation to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

### 🚀 Features

*   **Data Ingestion:** Automatically loads raw trekking data.
*   **Data Transformation:** Cleans, preprocesses, and engineers features from the raw data. Handles categorical and numerical data using pipelines.
*   **Model Training:** Trains various regression models to find the best fit for cost prediction.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like R2 score, MAE, and RMSE.
*   **Prediction Pipeline:** Provides an interface to get cost predictions for new trekking plans.
*   **Web Application:** A user-friendly Flask web application for interactive predictions.

### 🔁 End-to-end Pipeline (detailed)
1. Data Ingestion
   - Load raw CSV/JSON from local or S3
   - Validate schema (types, missing columns)
2. Data Validation & Cleaning
   - Drop or impute missing values with defined strategy
   - Remove duplicates, filter outliers
   - Save a processed snapshot for reproducibility
3. Feature Engineering
   - Encode categorical features (OneHot / Ordinal / Target encoding)
   - Scale numeric features when required (Standard/MinMax)
   - Create domain features (duration, altitude_diff, group_size_flags)
   - Build a scikit-learn Pipeline to encapsulate transforms
4. Train / Validation Split
   - Time-based or stratified split depending on data
   - Persist split indices for reproducibility
5. Model Training
   - Baselines: LinearRegression, RandomForest
   - Tuned: XGBoost / CatBoost with CV (Grid/Random/Bayesian)
   - Use early stopping and custom loss if needed
6. Evaluation
   - Metrics: R², MAE, RMSE
   - Residual/error analysis and feature importance
   - Save evaluation report and model artifact
7. Packaging & Serving
   - Export model as joblib / pickle / ONNX (if applicable)
   - Create Flask endpoints for prediction and health checks
   - Containerize with Docker
8. Deployment & Monitoring
   - Deploy to cloud or VM, add logging, and metrics (Prometheus / Grafana)
   - Monitor input drift and prediction quality
9. CI/CD & Automation
   - Tests: unit tests for preprocessors, integration tests for endpoints
   - Automate training pipeline with GitHub Actions / Azure Pipelines (optional)

### 🔬 Modeling Notes & Best Practices
- Use pipelines to avoid train/validation leakage
- Log hyperparameters and metrics per run (MLflow / simple JSON logs)
- Use cross-validation and holdout test set for final evaluation
- Prefer reproducible environments (requirements.txt + Dockerfile)
- Track data version and model artifacts (DVC or cloud storage)

### 🚀 How to Run (quick)
- Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Prepare data: put raw files into data/raw/ (see schema in data/)
- Train: python src/models/train.py --config configs/train.yaml
- Serve: python src/api/app.py  (or docker build && docker run)

### 🔁 Deployment Tips
- Serve a single prediction endpoint: POST /predict with JSON schema
- Add input schema validation (pydantic or marshmallow)
- Enable CORS for frontend, limit rate-limiting for production
- Add health endpoint /health and metrics endpoint /metrics

### ✅ Testing, Logging & Monitoring
- Unit tests for transformers and feature logic
- Integration tests for model end-to-end predictions
- Structured logs (JSON) and request tracing IDs for debugging
- Alerting for model performance regression and data schema changes

### ☑️ Reproducibility & Governance
- Pin package versions
- Store preprocessing code with model artifact
- Keep changelog for dataset and model updates
- Maintain clear LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md

### 📚 Useful Files to Add
- requirements.txt
- Dockerfile
- configs/train.yaml (hyperparams & paths)
- scripts/prepare_data.sh
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
