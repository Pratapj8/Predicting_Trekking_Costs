# End-to-end Trekking_cost_predict

## 🏞️ Trekking Cost Predictor ⛰️

Welcome to the Trekking Cost Predictor project! This is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to estimate the cost of a trekking trip based on various factors. Whether you're planning a solo adventure or a group expedition, this tool can help you budget effectively.

### ✨ Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict trekking costs. It covers the entire ML lifecycle, from data ingestion and transformation to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

### 🚀 Features

*   **Data Ingestion:** Automatically loads raw trekking data.
*   **Data Transformation:** Cleans, preprocesses, and engineers features from the raw data. Handles categorical and numerical data using pipelines.
*   **Model Training:** Trains various regression models to find the best fit for cost prediction.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like R2 score, MAE, and RMSE.
*   **Prediction Pipeline:** Provides an interface to get cost predictions for new trekking plans.
*   **Web Application:** A user-friendly Flask web application for interactive predictions.
